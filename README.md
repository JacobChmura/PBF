# PBF
Position Based Fluid Simulation

### TODO

* ~~Setup Simulation Framework~~
* ~~Simulate gravity and collision detection with bounding box~~
* ~~Implement Spatial Hashing Grid for efficient Neighbourhood Finding~~
* ~~Barebones PBF Implementation (dam break)~~
* ~~Implement multiple scenes~~
* ~~UI Toggles~~
* Cleanup
* Viscocity / Vorticity working
* particle ejector / manual external forces
* Optimize
* Aesthetics / Surfacing?
